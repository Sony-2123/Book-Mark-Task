        <h2>Prologue</h2>
        <pre>Prologue: The Origin of the Moonstone
            The story begins with the history of the Moonstone, a large, valuable yellow diamond stolen from a Hindu temple in India. The diamond is said to be cursed and protected by Indian priests who are sworn to recover it. During a military campaign in India, an English officer, Colonel John Herncastle, steals the diamond and brings it back to England.
            
            Part One: The Theft of the Diamond
            The main story takes place years later at Rachel Verinder‚Äôs 18th birthday party at her family estate in Yorkshire. Rachel‚Äôs cousin, Franklin Blake, delivers the Moonstone as a birthday gift, following the wishes of her recently deceased uncle, Colonel Herncastle.
            
            That night, the diamond mysteriously disappears from Rachel‚Äôs bedroom. Suspicion falls on various guests and servants. The case is complicated by the presence of three mysterious Indian men who had been seen lurking near the estate, presumably searching for the stolen diamond.
            
            Part Two: The Investigation
            The investigation is initially led by Sergeant Cuff, a renowned detective, who suspects that Rachel herself may be hiding the truth. Rachel, however, refuses to cooperate, and the case goes unsolved. Soon after, she distances herself from Franklin Blake and even becomes engaged to another man, Godfrey Ablewhite, a seemingly respectable philanthropist.
            
            As the months pass, Franklin is tormented by the unsolved mystery. Determined to clear his name, he resumes the investigation with the help of Ezra Jennings, an assistant to Dr. Candy, a physician who had attended the birthday party.
            
            Part Three: The Truth Revealed
            Ezra Jennings devises a clever experiment using opium, as Dr. Candy had earlier given Franklin an opium-laced drink without his knowledge. Under the influence of opium, Franklin unknowingly took the Moonstone from Rachel‚Äôs room and hid it elsewhere. However, he does not remember doing so, making him an innocent but crucial player in the theft.
            
            Eventually, it is discovered that Godfrey Ablewhite was the actual culprit. He had taken advantage of Franklin‚Äôs confused state, retrieved the diamond, and pawned it to pay off his debts. However, before he could sell the Moonstone, the Indian priests tracked him down and killed him, successfully reclaiming the sacred jewel.
            
            Epilogue: Justice and Resolution
            With the case solved, Franklin and Rachel reconcile and marry. The Moonstone is restored to its rightful place in the temple in India, ending the curse that haunted it.
            
            Themes in The Moonstone
            The Role of Detective Fiction ‚Äì The novel introduces key elements of detective fiction: multiple suspects, red herrings, a brilliant investigator, and a shocking reveal.
            Colonialism & Cultural Conflict ‚Äì The story critiques British imperialism and the theft of sacred Indian artifacts.
            Science vs. Superstition ‚Äì Opium and its effects play a crucial role in unraveling the mystery, blending medical science with elements of fate and destiny.
            Class & Gender Issues ‚Äì The novel explores the expectations placed on women like Rachel and contrasts the moral weaknesses of upper-class figures like Godfrey Ablewhite.

        <h2>Ackroyd</h2>
        <pre>
            The Murder of Roger Ackroyd by Agatha Christie (1926)
            One of Agatha Christie's most famous and cleverly structured mysteries, The Murder of Roger Ackroyd is a classic whodunit featuring Hercule Poirot, the famous Belgian detective. The novel is known for its shocking twist and innovative storytelling.
            
            Plot Summary
            The Setting & The Crime
            The story takes place in the quiet English village of King‚Äôs Abbot. The wealthy businessman Roger Ackroyd lives in a grand estate, Fernly Park. He is engaged to Mrs. Ferrars, a wealthy widow rumored to have poisoned her late husband.
            
            One evening, Roger receives a letter from Mrs. Ferrars, confessing that she was being blackmailed. Before he can finish reading it, he is murdered in his study, stabbed with a dagger. The letter disappears.
            
            The Investigation Begins
            Hercule Poirot, who has retired to King‚Äôs Abbot to grow vegetables, is reluctantly pulled into the case by Dr. James Sheppard, the village doctor and narrator of the story. Poirot examines the clues:
            
            A locked room, suggesting the killer staged the scene.
            A missing letter, which might reveal the blackmailer.
            A mysterious stranger seen near Fernly Park.
            A series of lies, as every suspect seems to be hiding something.
            The Suspects
            Ralph Paton ‚Äì Ackroyd‚Äôs stepson and heir, who is deeply in debt and disappears after the murder.
            Flora Ackroyd ‚Äì Roger‚Äôs niece, who claims she saw her uncle alive after the supposed time of death.
            Parker ‚Äì The butler, who acts suspiciously and might know more than he admits.
            Major Blunt ‚Äì A friend of Ackroyd with a secret romantic interest in Flora.
            Ursula Bourne ‚Äì A housemaid who turns out to be secretly married to Ralph.
            Dr. Sheppard ‚Äì The local doctor who found the body and narrates the investigation.
            The Shocking Twist
            Poirot gathers everyone and announces the murderer: Dr. Sheppard, the narrator himself!
            
            Dr. Sheppard had been the one blackmailing Mrs. Ferrars. Fearing exposure when she confessed in the letter, he murdered Ackroyd before he could read it. He then cleverly manipulated the narrative, misleading the reader just as he misled Poirot.
            
            Poirot gives Sheppard the chance to take his own life rather than face trial. The novel ends with Sheppard writing his confession before committing suicide.
            
            Why This Story Is Famous
            ‚úî Unreliable Narrator ‚Äì The entire novel is told from the murderer's point of view, but the deception is so subtle that the twist is shocking.
            ‚úî Innovative Plot Structure ‚Äì Agatha Christie broke traditional rules of mystery writing, making this book one of the greatest whodunits of all time.
            ‚úî Hercule Poirot‚Äôs Deduction ‚Äì Poirot‚Äôs meticulous reasoning and psychological insights make for a satisfying resolution.
